About a decade ago Pisoli was just farm land but due to the influx of IT and the commercial growth of the city, property prices skyrocketed in the established locations. Educational Institutions like Narayanrao Sanas Vidyalaya, D.A.V Public School and Sant Tukaram English School which are located in close vicinity of Pisoli have proven to be a very welcomed convenience in this area.
